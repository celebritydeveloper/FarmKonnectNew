                        <h3>Aquaculture Project</h3>
                        <p>The  earliest  of  our  projects  is  the  aquaculture,  starting  from  a  single  pond  in Mokola, we now have farms for production of up to 100 Tons of catfish per month. 
                            Our operation is not limited to catfish, but after 7 years of research and deliberate investments, we are now at the fore front of production of Pangasius hypothalmus, which is a more palatable and healthier fresh/brackish water fish. 
                            The acceptance of Pangaius Niloticus promises a better future than catfish. 
                            Not limiting our operations, we also delve into other species such as Gymnachos Niloticus, Heterotis, Tilapia, and many other  fresh  water  species  that  could  be  farmed  in  Nigeria. With a population of 190 Million, fish deficit in excess of 2 Million Tons per annum and the profitability of aquaculture is unlimited. 
                            It is the major source of animal protein to African countries and can be consumed both in local and export market. 
                            The vision of FarmKonnect is to be the biggest producers of these fishes in Nigeria, then in West Africa. </p>

                        <h3>Igbeja Snail Village</h3>
                        <p>Working  in  partnership  with  and  under  the  tutelage of Touchstone  Snails  Technology Limited,  Lanarca, Cyprus, we are currently developing Africa’s largest snail facility tagged  Igbeja  Snail  Village.  With  a  setup  estimate  of  13.7  Million  Dollars  (5  Billion Naira) the first phase of the project will house 100 Units of snail breeding facility.
                             We believe that the project should not just be about farming, we should also add glamour to our work, so we will put a touch of tourism and world class hospitality. It is opened to investors as per phase, the first phase is the farm construction and operation which will produce minimum of 2.6 Million Kg (26,000 Metric Tons) of snails per annum, with a  return  on  investment  as  high  as  59%  from  the  first  year  of  production.  
                             All  snails produced are for the export market. 
                            There is also a future consideration towards local processing for slime, meat and caviar. </p>

                        <p>With food market in the GCC countries in excess of 140Bn USD per annum and estimated to hit 400Bn USD by 2014. 
                                Nigeria capturing a fraction of this will be a great deal! Thus, utilizing the Harmiyya Food Pack in UAE, FarmKonnect works towards the full utilization of African food hub to repackage African Food for further export to other parts of the world. 
                                There is nothing wrong in having outlets in major countries of the world where Africans need to connect with African food. </p>

                                The app will be for investments management, farm management, and directory  of  farmers, link to market and consultancy services, 
                                as well as agricultural library and other services that will enable a farmer easily manage and sell his farm activities and produce.

                            <p>As at 2018, South Africa is the only African Country among 27 top producers of Mushroom in the world. It is the desire of FarmKonnect to bring Nigeria into the list. 
                                We are currently undergoing training and research on how to put mushroom forward as one ofour mega projects and will soon start to invest in this project.  </p>

                            <p>We have carried out series of research on Ostrich farming and we know it is a huge under tapped opportunity in Nigeria. A great source of lean red meat with a relatively better Feed Conversion Ratio (FCR) than cattle; therefore, promising great profits. 
                                Due to the prolific nature of the flightless bird and its excellent feed conversion rate, it is a rewarding venture that requires large space and capital to thrive. 
                                After having tested this venture, FarmKonnect is working toward raising a 10,000 mature female ostrich farm. </p>

                        <p>Malnutrition is a dimension to look at in Africa’s battle for food insecurity. 
                            Poverty has made access to animal protein difficult to many. Apart from this, the global community is fast looking at the other dimensions of sourcing healthier and affordable high quality protein and probiotics. Insects promise to offer such for the future. 
                            It is high time we began to look towards raring these beautiful creatures for their benefits. 
                            At FarmKonnect, our focus of research and investment include but not limited to locust, cricket, edible worms, honey and bumble bees, cockroaches. </p>

            <h2>Project Approach</h2>
            <p>Since our projects are majorly financed by sponsors, we need to put adequate effort towards ensuring the success of the projects;
                 consequently, we have four stages of our projects:</p>

                    <h3>Testing</h3>
                    <p>Before considering any project for funding, we first test the project on very small scale to be sure that it can be supported locally and possibly result in profit. 
                        If we find a project feasible, we design a large scale concept around it.</p>

                    <h3>Pilot</h3>
                    <p>Before going full blown, we start off all large scale projects with a pilot phase which is usually 10 to 20 percent of the full scale. 
                        This allows us to mitigate risk and be assured of the smooth running of our projects when fully commenced.</p>
